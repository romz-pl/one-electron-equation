1. On IBM Power 775 BOREASZ the script 'install-all' installing the  program RSchr-5.x
   does not work. The problem is the installation of PETSc, since PETSc requires 
   submiting the job to the qeueing system.
   
2. In order to instal RSchr-5.x do the following steps:
   0) change directory to ./ins/boreasz-pwr
   1) run ./install-lapack
   2) run ./install-parmetis
   3) run ./install-petsc-a (configuration)
   4) run ./install-petsc-b (submiting a job to queuing system)
   5) wait untill the submited job is completed
   6) run ./install-petsc-a (reconfiguration + compilation)
   7) run ./instal-slepc
   8) run ./istall-rschr
