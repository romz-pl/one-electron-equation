    How to run the Program RSchr-5.6?

=================================================

1. Program RSchr expects two arguments. 


2. The first argument is the path to file with parameters. 


3. The second argument is the path to file with  definition of interaction potential. 


4. If the first argument is 'param.inp' and the second argument is 'pot.def, 
   then one must type in command line
       mpiexec -np 1 rschr.x  -a ./param.inp  -b ./pot.def
       
       
5. Be sure that the path to directory with executable rschr.x is on the "path". 


6. Both input files (param.inp and pot.def) are text files. 


7. The forma of 'param.inp' file is described in 'input-parameters.txt'.


8. Th format of 'pot.def' file is described in 'potential-definition.txt'.


9. Any argument for PETSc can be added in command line, for example:
     mpiexec rschr.x -vecscatter_alltoall -a ./param.inp -b ./pot.def > rschr.out
