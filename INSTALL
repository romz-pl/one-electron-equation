========================================================================

1. The program RSchr-5 is disributed in the source code form, as a one file:
      rschr-5.x.tar.gz

2. After unziping and untaring, one directory is created.

3. The Program RSchr must be compiled by MPI C++ compiler.

4. In order to compile and install RSchr-5, you must have 
   installed on your computer:
      - C++ compiler (g++)
      - fortran compiler (gfortran)
      - MPI (Message Passing Interface)

5. In order to install RSchr-5 with all depedencies, from the 
   main directory run the script:
      ./install-all
      
6. The installation script ./install-all works fine on 
   Linux with GCC compiler.

7. On other systems the instalation script must be set up.
   There are instalation scripts for 'IBM Blue Gene/P notos' and 
   'IBM Power 775 boreasz'.

8. Source files and Makefile are in ./src directory.

9. The program RSchr depends on the following libraries:
       - BLAS,
       - LAPACK,
       - MPI,
       - PETSc,
       - ParMetis,
       - SLEPc
       
       
10. All the above listed libraries (except MPI) are distributed with RSchr-5.


11. After installation, the executable rschr.x can be found in the directory:
      ./bin

12. For more information, see README file and documentation in ./doc directory.
