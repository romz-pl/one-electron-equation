1. The program RSchr-5 calculates the smallest eigenvalues of 
   the one-electron Schr√∂dinger equation:

   [ -0.5 * \nabla^2 + U(r) ] \Psi(r) = \lambda \Psi(r)

2. This is the partial differential eigenvalue problem.

3. The problem is defined on the finite domain \Omega.

4. In the current implementation the domain \Omega is the box
   given by the cartesian product: 
     \Omega = [x0, x1] x [y0, y1] x [z0, z1]

5. The problem is solved with the zero Dirichlet applied on the boundary 
   of \Omega boundary conditions:
       \Psi(t) = 0  for each t \in \Omega

6. The implementation is based on Message Passing Interface (MPI).

7. The discretization of the above differential eigenvalue problem is done
   by Finite Element method with B-splines as a basis functions.
   
8. Disctretization leads to generalized eigenvalue problem.

9. RSchr-5 solves the generalized eigenvalue problem using SLEPc amd PETSc libraries.
   
9. The program RSchr is implemented in C++, it runs under MPI.

10. Further information related to the algorithm can be found in the reference article.
